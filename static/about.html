<h1>Latin scansion engine about</h1>
<p>This web app uses a series of grammars implemented as weighted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">finite-state automata</a> to recover the scansion, and implied phonetic transcription, of Latin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dactylic_hexameter">dactylic hexameter</a> poetry. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil">Virgil</a>'s <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeneid">Aeneid</a></i> was used to develop this tool, though it should work for other Latin authors and poems that use this meter.</p>
<p>The grammars themselves were created using <a href="https://thrax.opengrm.org/">Thrax</a>, a domain-specific language (and associated compiler) for developing finite-state grammars. Our own <tt><a href="https://github.com/CUNY-CL/latin_scansion">latin_scansion</a></tt> library
acts as a backend. It applies the Thrax grammars to the input using <a href=https://pynini.opengrm.org>Pynini</a>, a Python extension library for finite-state grammar development, and outputs a custom <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">protocol buffer</a> containing the scan and phonetic transcription. The <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/">Flask</a> web framework and the <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/">Jinja</a> template engine are then used to render the scansion/transcription protocol buffer. The site itself is served by the <a href="https://gunicorn.org/">Gunicorn</a> web server.</p>
<p>The finite-state grammars process the input strings in the following order:
<ol>
<li><tt><a href="https://github.com/CUNY-CL/latin_scansion/blob/master/grammars/normalize.grm">normalize.grm</a></tt> removes punctuation and case-folds.</li>
<li><tt><a href="https://github.com/CUNY-CL/latin_scansion/blob/master/grammars/pronounce.grm">pronounce.grm</a></tt> applies Latin grapheme-to-phoneme rules to obtain a broad phonetic transcription.</li>
<li><tt><a href="https://github.com/CUNY-CL/latin_scansion/blob/master/grammars/variable.grm">variable.grm</a></tt> optionally applies various phonetic rules associated with scansion (rules such as elision and resyllabification). These variable rules are all associated with non-zero weights and so they are only applied when needed to "make the meter".</li>
<li><tt><a href="https://github.com/CUNY-CL/latin_scansion/blob/master/grammars/syllable.grm">syllable.grm</a></tt> syllabifies the phonetic transcriptions and subdivides into onset, nucleus, and coda.</li>
<li><tt><a href="https://github.com/CUNY-CL/latin_scansion/blob/master/grammars/weight.grm">weight.grm</a></tt> codes syllables as heavy or light.</li>
<li><tt><a href="https://github.com/CUNY-CL/latin_scansion/blob/master/grammars/foot.grm">foot.grm</a></tt> groups sequences of heavy and light syllables into dactyls, spondees, and trochees.</li>
<li><tt><a href="https://github.com/CUNY-CL/latin_scansion/blob/master/grammars/hexameter.grm">hexameter.grm</a></tt> filters foot sequences to only those permitted in a hexameter verse.</li>
</ol>
<p>To obtain the final scan and narrow phonetic transcription, these grammars are applied in the order they are listed in above, at each step creating a weighted lattice of possible analyses. The best analysis consistent with the rules of Latin meter are obtained by computing the shortest path of the final lattice, and intermediate analyses (of feet, weight, syllable structure, etc.) are recovered by further composition with that shortest path.</p>
<p>In the case these later composition steps fail, the line is coded as defective and intermediate analyses depending on the constraints of hexameter are not available. In practice defective lines may represent a deliberate poetic effect used at the ends of stanzas ("books"), rare effects of poetic license not currently modeled&mdash;systole, diastole, and hypermeter&mdash;or simply incomplete lines.</p>
